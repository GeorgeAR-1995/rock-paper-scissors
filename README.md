# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple web-based Rock Paper Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The player selects one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer randomly selects one as well. The result of the game (win, lose, or draw) is displayed after each round.

## Features

- **Player vs. Computer**: Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors and compare your choice against the computer's random choice.
